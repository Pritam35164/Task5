# Heart Disease Prediction with Decision Trees & Random Forests

This project demonstrates how **tree-based machine learning models** can be applied to predict the presence of **heart disease** using the popular **Heart Disease dataset**.

---

## Whatâ€™s Inside?
We cover the full workflow:
1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Train a tree and visualize it
   - Understand overfitting and fix it by controlling depth
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Train an ensemble of trees for better accuracy
   - Compare results with Decision Tree
3. **Feature Importance**
   - Find which features (like chest pain type, max heart rate, etc.) are most important
4. **Cross-Validation**
   - Evaluate models for stability and generalization
5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports
